# Day14

Here comes two more tasks: \(Heidegger, Cuto\). So the landscape is:

* Customs are \(\)
* Tasks are \(iOS, LeetCode, Cuto, Duolingo, Heidegger\)
* Consumptions are \(Mood, Brain, Time\)
  * Recoveries are \(Cuto, Microlight, HoK\)

I can see those things can easily scale. But my own managing lagged long after the current landscape.

The other problem is that there is subtle change happening in Cuto's heart and I failed to catch it.

These two problems are I am facing currently.

For the first problem I need to elevate its prominence somehow. I arrange my desktop with sticker listing tasks and apple-music-small-window. It feels really good. It makes me think Arrangement should be in my Aesthetics. I should arrange my phone, mac, room, surrounding, relationship to make task gets its deserved prominence. Only having laid down the foundation of Arrangement, the Management becomes possible.

For the second problem I need to try to catch with Cuto when she comes back.

A human faces choices and he hates choosing. He wants both and all. But he have to and must choose. In this way, human becomes different from each other. So the criteria will be what I want to become.

A human faces directions and frontiers. He must decide which direction to advance frontier for how long and how far, which is one round after another round. And the criteria will be business-needs.

A human faces \(hungry, sleepy\), which is indicator to rest and relax. But apart from these legal indicator, I take extra rest just to play HoK...  I 坐不住，多动症, which significantly decrease my throughput. I should optimize out this bad habit. Actually, this may be cause by my long-term-free-will. If I somehow weaken my free-will, I can get benefits as a whole and for long term. Apparently, Sports and Sex are two approaches. The feeling of \(hungry, sleep, tired\) is actually a great experience. I should enjoy it from now on.
