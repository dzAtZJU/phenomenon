# Day8

Yesterday I came to a milestone, which I should stress now.

* Customs are \(\)
* Tasks are \(iOS, LeetCode, Duolingo\)
* Consumptions are \(Mood, Brain\)
  * Recoveries are \(Microlight, HoK\)

There is no doubt that I am convinced by \(Tasks, Consumptions\(Recoveries\)\). So this can be a terrific starting point.

What worries me is that there is still something missing. When I sit down at the cafe and staring to drink coffee, I have no natural tendency to do a task.

This problem has occurred before. SystemEvent, HoK, Youtube all used to be my first thing to do in the morning. I realized that I surrendered to either bad-habit or external-disturbing. So if I don't like bad-habit or external-disturbing at all, what will I like? 

See, this pattern of question is always what a human has to face. A human see and feel things, some of which he realizes he doesn't like, often, he doesn't like all of them. Thus he needs fresh things and inspirations.

What are inspirations now? What can I put up with to try as the first thing to do in the morning. Reviewing, Stepping from yesterday's content, just like a professor will do in class. I need to promote the prominence of yesterday's content so that I can feel it naturally and quickly. Image&Music thus need to comes to help.
