# Day11

Today starts with extra worries from the-others. D, S, Cuto are resolved. The remaining is M, which extends to Mr.Z and SH.Z.

Now let's continue what I am reading yesterday. This is a really case that I connect my days. This time, I achieve connections by reading complex materials, which intrinsically possess time-connecting quality. This case inspires me that maybe my Aesthetics for materials should include Day-Spanning. When I finished reading swift-switch-to-utf8 article, this connection then comes to an end. I am again trapped in a situation where I have to think about the next step. This context-switch is an overhead in time. The ideal situation should be focus on one topic day after day without topic-switch.

I feel tired and hungry after reading vm guide. There was then bad feelings coming out of my heart. I went to PingChengWu for manyu-rice and I felt better there. The food, the atmosphere, the music, the tv there all makes me feel better and thus I began to think positive aspects like Cuto, Living in Japan, Becoming a talent. At the same time, I found that learning-Japanese is a slow process since I can't understand what Japanese-circle-on-Microlight is talking even after I have learnt Japanese for one month. This fact makes me reconsider my learning-iOS-by-materials. Maybe learning-iOS-by-materials is also a slow process so that only after a period I can talk with interviewer. Maybe studying and researching is such a process that with high-cost but low-gain at beginning period. I downloaded Hok again. This time, I know I need it when I am brain-exhausted only and will not regard it a goal to up-score. 

Exhausting-Feeling is transient. I should adjust my feeling, get a break like when physically tired. The important thing is to hold on to studying. Ask myself, do I believe in my aim and goal? Yes, I truly believe in my aim and goal. And maybe any valid and profound aim and goal at the same time bring a exhausting process at beginning.

Feelings-and-Interpretations can really be manipulated by myself. I should make sure my direction and goal can stand economically and profoundly. Then I will manipulate my Feelings-and-Interpretations to help myself hold on in tough days.
