# Day1

I felt tired after finishing watching a wwdc video with high attention. I stood up and went to the restroom. Then it comes to such a moment that I don't know what to do next.

I played one round of game and felt that's enough.

I am going to try learning Japanese then. I felt that's enough.

If there are more than two fields, maybe I will be happy to try each one  in turn. So what's the third field? That must come from my goal.

My nearest goal is iOS Interview.

My second nearest goal is Japanese.

Maybe I should not go so far to the third nearest goal.

So I should explore what else I can do for iOS Interview. That should be different from what I did earlier or I will feel boring. Okay, I will have a look at the interview questions and see if there is something interesting for current moment. I am going to give threading a chance. But before that, I am hungry so I can eat something.

I want to see if there is any friend studying CS on MicroLight. There is not...

Why I am so reluctant to start reading "About Threaded Programming"? Should I push myself? Or can I somehow make myself feel like doing this? But how can I have feelings about this document when I don't even know it? This document is strange to me, it comes to my sight only because it is is under the topic threading and it was from Apple. So do I have any feeling about the topic threading? Do I feel wanting to know more about threading?

The above is the journey based on feeling. There is possibility that feeling is not the right thing as the starting point. If so, what else can be the starting point? 

There is such reality that I do like to be together with the girl I like, talking with her, playing game with her, making love with her and sleeping with her. That is an undeniable fact. 

Well, I push myself reading this document and kind of feel I am attracted to language and intrinsic concepts.
