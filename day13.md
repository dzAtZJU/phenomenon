# Day13

I can't calm down again. I think the reason is that I am not satisfied with how I deal with Cuto's rising chatting-needs this morning-noon-early-afternoon. The better way should be that I arrange my reading later and chat with her just in time when she needs. She repeated that she was boring. She expressed dissatisfaction that no one chats with her. I do care about her. Why did't I respond to her needs? Because I have a more important task that I need to read materials. So am I able to satisfy both needs? It turns out that I should be able to. Since I have a whole day to read and I even played HoK after she went to game. Then why I didn't behave that way? I think the reason is that I have misconception about time. I should consider time at a scale of a day, instead of moment. Moreover, theres is scale of a week, a month, a year, etc. These scales should be somehow be visioned as map to cause greater feelings on me as they deserve. Now I should reflected on why I chose to play HoK. I think its because that I lost sight of bigger-scale versions of time. And why I chose to decline invitation from girl-teammate for joining with FON. I think its also because that I lost sight of bigger-scale-versions of time. Now, let's deal with the guilty I felt strongly for Cuto. If I enlarge the time-vision to expand to tonight, then I have time to talk with her and check her feeling about this morning. Should I check with her now? No, I should't. Lost is lost, the best chance has passed away and I have to wait until night.

Now, the grand picture disagrees with the minor picture. Should follow the grand or the minor? I have to make choice. I can't dropped into bad feelings. If there must be choice, it has to be the grand one. As for this hard situation, It can be sang on.
