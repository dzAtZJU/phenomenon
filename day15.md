# Day15

Between Current-Pleasure vs Later-Trouble, I until now choose the first. The embarrassment is that I can't have both and must have something to lose. So the situation is I have to measure and compare the Gain-VS-Lost. This measure-compare doesn't belong to the kingdom of feeling but the kingdom of thinking. Current-feeling is sacrificed for longer-term-feeling. According to this logic, I need to adherer to my planned-tasks and when feelings come I should soothe them with low-cost and stay-in-track. If so, maybe feelings are what needs soothing and are like kids.

The feeling is actually 赌徒心理。HoK invoke 赌徒心理 inside me. I want to practice to be better at playing, I want to train myself. But the fact is my brain is already exhausted. So the situation is \(Brain-Eye-Exhausted, 不甘心-Training\). This situation itself can never fulfill the 不甘心-Training feeling. How about I just play one round. If win, fine. But often time I lose. Then I will choose to play again, after which I get exhausted. So the often situation where I am in is I am Brain-Eye-Exhausted after playing two rounds. Then my original aim to recover failed. If I play just one round and get relax that's fine. However, often I play one round and lose, at which time I get relaxing but a new feeling called 不甘心-Training arise. So I have to deal this extra feeling, which is totally unnecessary. Remember that a human's mental-energy is limited per-day. If I spend some here then I have less to deal with other things. So the gain is relaxing, the cost is mental-energy. If I choose to train and keep playing the cost will then be \(time, exhausted\) and the gain will be sharped-HoK-skill. So there are only two possible results:

gain: relax. cost: mental-energy

gain: HoK-skill. cost: time, exhausted

I dislike either of them.
