# Day15

Between Current-Pleasure vs Later-Trouble, I until now choose the first. The embarrassment is that I can't have both and must have something to lose. So the situation is I have to measure and compare the Gain-VS-Lost. This measure-compare doesn't belong to the kingdom of feeling but the kingdom of thinking. Current-feeling is sacrificed for longer-term-feeling.
