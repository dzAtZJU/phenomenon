# Make it feel natural

1. Learn Japanese for warming-up

   Writing and recording for calming down

   Nils Frahm as background music for Soul-Fun. 有感觉了哼几句

2. Starting from Japanese, imagine walking to iOS somehow
3. The Reading-Process can be more fun if Reading-Out and Singing-Out

after finishing watching a video, feel a little tired. What should I do next? empty runloop? self-assigned task? play one round of game? market needs?

I feel that 

* memory area
* Scenario-based rendering analysis
* VC lifecycle
* GCD

should be the next topic for me. Its good news, isn't it?

When there are all kinds of things pushing into my front, I need to calm down and evaluate them in terms of my own systematic hierarchy.

When it comes to a huge landscape or machine or mechanism, high level language must be used to cover the topic, resulting in ambiguity. Digging is thus needed. High level language must be organized with rich connections and fine textures.
