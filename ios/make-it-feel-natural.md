# Make it feel natural

1. Learn Japanese for warming-up

   Writing and recording for calming down

   Nils Frahm as background music for Soul-Fun. 有感觉了哼几句

2. Starting from Japanese, imagine walking to iOS somehow
3. The Reading-Process can be more fun if Reading-Out and Singing-Out

after finishing watching a video, feel a little tired. What should I do next? empty runloop? self-assigned task? play one round of game? market needs?
