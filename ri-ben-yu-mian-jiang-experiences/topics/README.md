# Topics

I don't like the topic Direction because I consider it to be useless when I can use map on my iPhone. The foremost criteria for Knowledge is usefulness, since Knowledge is infinite. Secondly, the Direction related is too plain.

But Duolingo requires level1 for each class unit. I hate it. I have to do it, so I choose to do it in a scanning way.

Grammar is more intelligently beautiful but is more time-consuming to read.
