# Day10

I sat down, on the comfortable seat, with a coffee, isn't it a 気持ち start of a day?Again, at this starting time, I need to do morning routine.

As I got off the 電車 and walked on the street with trees and buildings, listening J-Music, and with my HeadSpace filling with and only with interviewing, Cuto, しね, I feel already that I was in Tokyo. My whole world include physical and mental shrinks to a simple but strong core. I feel that my daily life begin to connect. How does this happen? The honor should be granted to Apple-Music, Tokyo-Like-Neighborhood, Duolingo, Microlight-Cuto-Shine. How does these elements make my Daily-Life connecting? Actually, Apple-Music&Tokyo-Like-Neighborhood contributes to Immersive, Duolingo&Microlight-Cuto-Shine contributes to Progressing. So the conclusion comes at Daily-Life Aesthetics include Immersive and Progressing.

Now let turn to Career-Life. Since I officially put with this noun, I give it independent status. Career-Life can be so different with Daily-Life that  Experience,Situation,Event,Habits,Minds need to have a different structure. I now officially recognize this viewpoint. Now a question comes that is it possible and valid for build connections between Daily-Life and Career-Life? Since Smoothing is in my Aesthetics so I do want to bring smooth to the gap between Daily-Life and Career-Life. At this time, what comes to my mind is that several Key-Human acts as the bridge. They are Mr.Zhou, SH.Zhou, Shelly, Shelly.1st.Interviewer. Talking with them belongs to Daily-Life, which produce effects on Career-Life, that is, motivate myself to try to arrange Daily-Life toward Career-Life. One thing should be reminded is that Career-Life always involves Multi-Side. Daily-Life and later Creative-Life may only involve myself. With these connections and interactions, Drawing&Mapping will show their importance in the future, I believe so. Diary for sure has its status since it is helping me to think and cover.

Now its enough about meta-thinking. Let's go back to preparing for interviewing.

### Shelly.1st.Interviewer

* situation for me
  * 2nd.Interview
  * he kept polite to me
  * preparing direction
* situation for them

    * He actually  thinks I am weak in \(Alogs, Basics, Experience\)
    *  He wants to see how I think, analyze, approach when facing a problem and situation
  * need human-resource
* QA
  * 都是可以学的，看重的思考分析方式

about market, seller, buyer. A human itself is a universe, thus when he starts to want to join a market, this wishing itself is glory and should be honored since this human wants to make the common world a better place instead of staying in his own universe, in which sense, he is like a god coming down to the world. Then how will a god be treated? The first challenge a god has to face is to Fit himself into the market needs. He needs to first get infos about Market-Needs then proved himself that He can meet-the-needs. Thus an employer has the responsibility to give Market-Needs-Info, which is the reason why the interviewer keeps polite and casts one and another needs-point because it's his responsibility to Give-Market-Needs-Info. A god is not obliged to answer these needs right away. A god may decide he don't want to answer back these needs and thus quit the market, go back to his wonderful universe. Or a god by accident can meet the needs right away, which is a happy and lucky situation for both sides. The last case is that a god can't fulfill the needs right away but he want to develop to fulfill it. This is not a god's fault anyway, since the needs are generated from the employer's side. In this case, the employer should express that he wants the god to develop in orientation to its needs. This analysis applies to one-to-one-god-employer-market. For the market with over quantity of Gods, any god who get info earlier and develop earlier will catch the eye of the employer.

So, now, I decide to develop in oriented to last-interviewer's-needs. Since I am later then other gods, I have no competition advantage over other gods assuming other gods have well-defined-behavior. Now how should I face Phd-Circle, Tech-Leader-Circle, Relationship-Master-Circle? They each put more time and efforts to one distinct field. So I can't compete with them in those fields. I myself put more time and efforts in the Music-Language-Circle. So is there is a market whose needs include Language-Philo, then I will be the outstanding one in this market. I will have the most money  in this market. Still, money in this market may be less than that of Tech-Phd-Relationship-Market. Can I accept that? Yes, actually, because such a circle, market will become my daily world and I will be the king in this daily world. A God from his own universe doesn't need an earth-world but a circle-market-world. 

I reevaluate HoK again, based on Data, I found myself addicted into it. I can't say why, I don't want to regulate and control myself against it. It do bring me value when I am brain-tired but it costs me too much so its not economical. Developing myself around HoK will be a cost path. So I delete HoK again. Adult world is actually about Economic. 

When mood can't calm down, do something which doesn't require high focus and require saying at first, like Duolingo. And sit straight, breath deeply. And Apple-Music. Loud.

Twitter brings new circles into my front ,which are tech-talent circle and relationship-talent. I feel anxious. They each reach their own high achievement. As for me, I achieve nothing. I want big and achieve none. Why is that? How should I face these Phd, Tech-Leader, Relationship-Master? I declare and state that each one has its' own universe thus he can stand against any external factors. If so, what is my universe? How should I achieve in my universe? How should I present my universe and prove myself? I am slow, I want a reason that  will not blame on myself. I already think of the reason: My focus on Language is so foundational that one on this field must grow slowly. Yes, she may be a Relationship-Master, he may be a Phd, he may be a Tech-Leader, no matter what, I am the only Language-Reformer, which will influence the whole world. Thinking in this way, I can calm down and stand straight. Art-Language circe actually has far more less prominence then Tech circle in such an era. So I am also overcoming the weak point of this era. How can I not be slow?

Since now I joined a market which does not fit me the best, it's natural that I am not as good as others. The interviewer said what they really want is problem-situation-analyzing-solving-skill. A god who is good at this skill must also be good at \(basis, algos, experience\) since he needs a lot of exposures to be skilled. So actually what the interviewer is actually the Study-Adaptive-Ability. Of course I possess such meta ability. This fact reflects one fact that Study-Adaptive-Ability can be developed only in long term while skill and knowledge can be developed in short time. General-Ability is fostered and developed by \(family, school, university\) for 22 years. Employer is actually paying for this. If thus I regard General-Ability as a Standard-Line, then Top-Excel must not belong to General-Ability. Top-Excel actually is about Time-Effort. Thus I am top-excel in the field of Language-Reflection.

I need to show my General-Ability and Willing-Top-Excel-In-Tech to the interviewer.

How does this interviewer helps me to show? He put up situations and cases for me to analyze. However, this approach has intrinsic drawbacks that some-background-knowledge is required, some-context is required. I can:

1. learn more common language to help in this approach.
2. ask him to states and explain context.
   1. I need to make sure network and communication is good.
3. practice Algos. Since Algos has no-background-knowledge.
