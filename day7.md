# Day7

It's 8:19 now. My brain is exhausted. I realize that my day can not stand on just iOS and Duolingo. A third item must be introduced to fulfill one day. That is, my brain can't just focus on iOS and Duolingo whole day. Or actually, Microlight is the third item. Then, the conclusion is that:

My brain is unable to work whole day on \(iOS, Duolingo, Microlight\).

How do I arrange a day?

Tasks are \(iOS, Duolingo\).

Consumptions are \(Brain, Mood\).

Recoveries are \(Microlight\).

I will give Leetcode a try as the third Task. Actually, doing Leetcode feels good! So now routine becomes:  


* Customs are \(\)
* Tasks are \(iOS, LeetCode, Duolingo\)
* Consumptions are \(Mood, Brain\)
  * Recoveries are \(Microlight, HoK\)
