I am actually really interested in Politics. I believe in Humanity but the reality can be taken Violence&Deceive&Control. Why is that? Because some small groups benefit from Violence&Deceive&Control and gain Power thus they push Violence&Deceive&Control even further.

Watching youtube has the same psycho cost as Playing HoK. Well, this view of point reflects that I am becoming to put runloop and throughput at first, or say in another way, I in the this life stage put Study&Accumulation before Achieving. Does this tradeoff has potential? If Study&Accumulation is required before Achieving, then the answer is Yes.

When I incorporate new stuff, I should do it in a lowest and most simple way, both in time and in money. Because Time and Money should be focused on what is already in plan.
