I am actually really interested in Politics. I believe in Humanity but the reality can be taken Violence&Deceive&Control. Why is that? Because some small groups benefit from Violence&Deceive&Control and gain Power thus they push Violence&Deceive&Control even further.

Watching youtube has the same psycho cost as Playing HoK. Well, this view of point reflects that I am becoming to put runloop and throughput at first, or say in another way, I in the this life stage put Study&Accumulation before Achieving. Does this tradeoff has potential? If Study&Accumulation is required before Achieving, then the answer is Yes.

When I incorporate new stuff, I should do it in a lowest and most simple way, both in time and in money. Because Time and Money should be focused on what is already in plan.

I feel mental-exhausted and tired. The programming-guide-style docs just can't explain Block's memory-management well. Suitable materials matter a lot or students will suffer unnecessary suffers. At this point, I am totally qualified to play one round of game.

I decided to delete HoK. Yes, I failed to attack and win this game. It has time end mental costs. It is a good challenge. It can exercise my ability. Why I discard it now? Or, to say in a softer way, I delay it to later life stages. Is it such an important training for me now? How do I understand Professional? Different people are Professional in Different Fields. Even if I become Honor King and Professional in HoK, doest it mean I become Professional in another Field? No. Stepping back, will training in HoK sharpen one of my General-Skill? Yes, this time, I have to admit that. But, there are other General-Skills, which I am not among the top yet, which means, I can switch to other General-Skills now, since HoK makes me suffering recently. So, what's the conclusion? What about my lost time and energy on it? This situation is just like that with small-A previous days. If I stick to it for I have invest on it, I may incur larger costs. One fact for Adult is that there is NoPerfect and there is always Tragedy. I must jump out of this situation and tell myself: next time, I should be more considerate when deciding whether to start a new Journey. This line of thoughts makes me a real Conservatism, yes, Conservatism is now joined into my Aesthetics.
