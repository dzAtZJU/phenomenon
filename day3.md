# Day3

Today is different. I feel it.

I shall calm down right now. I have some unnamed feelings right in my heart. I can use an idle notification to process it. So I can focus on writing now.

I am drawn into Nil Frahm's Fundamental Values now. Just how beautiful it is.Who actually you are? Its is not what your are interested but what you have in your hand.

For the first time recently, I reach out to new topic. I want to step into new field. I surf Twitter and Youtube. I don't know what to do because I don't want to just start the same Duolingo routine. And Twitter and Youtube have notifications on y Screen. This actually reflects a universal phenomenon, that is , a human intrinsically doesn't know how to do timing-FM, which is the reason why a human need to be in a company and on social circles, for thus a human can receive events and notifications. A human is a runloop. Therefore, I do appreciate this tendency. However, Tendency needs to be regulated.

Say, I am attracted into how a Manager thinks, how a Career Life is, like, how Company works. An I followed someone with those topics on Twitter and Youtube. But again, keep this in mind, that a Human is defined first of all by what he does. Well, what he does actually cover what he is interested. But since interests are infinite and a Human is weak, bounded, limited. This contradiction is pervasive. A human can't do what he is interested for lack of time, resources, materials, money, relationships and so on. Those a Human do may not be the most interesting for him.

I must make the word interesting more clear and exact. I am convinced that Result and what it Leading to matter to me. I can't stress the Process anymore but Result is a must have for me. For instances, studying iOS leading to a well-pay-job, a career circle and a social circle, which again are all what I am interested. Studying Japanese leading to a Japanese social circle and career opportunities in Japan, which again are all what I dream for. Surfing Twitter and Youtube can be interesting during the process, but I can't gain Practical Result. Now, ask myself this question: which one I am interested more? I will say iOS and Japanese, during current life period. Now, I must add new element into my aesthetics. What is the new member? 

There are things in the world. Some you can have feelings easily. Some you can't. I must somehow see those I can't feel directly so I can measure how important they are to me and then personally lift their prominence to me so that I feel more natural to put time and efforts into it. Some are not interesting itself in Process but are extremely interesting in Result. So I have to somehow personally make the process interesting so that I fell more natural to put time and efforts into it.

See the good side, See the bad side. Not Covered by the good side, not Swept by the bad side.

When can't Perceive, I must Imagine.

Feeling is close to a Human. I am convinced Feeling is the right way. I give Feeling heavy weights. However and So, Feeling itself must be learnt more. The new knowledge about Feeling is that Horizon matters: Process, Result, Short-Term, Middle-Term, Long-Term.
