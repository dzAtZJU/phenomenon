# Day3

Today is different. I feel it.

I shall calm down right now. I have some unnamed feelings right in my heart. I can use an idle notification to process it. So I can focus on writing now.

I am drawn into Nil Frahm's Fundamental Values now. Just how beautiful it is.Who actually you are? Its is not what your are interested but what you have in your hand.

For the first time recently, I reach out to new topic. I want to step into new field. I surf Twitter and Youtube. I don't know what to do because I don't want to just start the same Duolingo routine. And Twitter and Youtube have notifications on y Screen. This actually reflects a universal phenomenon, that is , a human intrinsically doesn't know how to do timing-FM, which is the reason why a human need to be in a company and on social circles, for thus a human can receive events and notifications. A human is a runloop. Therefore, I do appreciate this tendency. However, Tendency needs to be regulated.

Say, I am attracted into how a Manager thinks, how a Career Life is, like, how Company works. An I followed someone with those topics on Twitter and Youtube. But again, keep this in mind, that a Human is defined first of all by what he does. Well, what he does actually cover what he is interested. But since interests are infinite and a Human is weak, bounded, limited. This contradiction is pervasive. A human can't do what he is interested for lack of time, resources, materials, money, relationships and so on. Those a Human do may not be the most interesting for him.

I must make the word interesting more clear and exact. I am convinced that Result and what it Leading to matter to me. I can't stress the Process anymore but Result is a must have for me. For instances, studying iOS leading to a well-pay-job, a career circle and a social circle, which again are all what I am interested. Studying Japanese leading to a Japanese social circle and career opportunities in Japan, which again are all what I dream for. Surfing Twitter and Youtube can be interesting during the process, but I can't gain Practical Result. Now, ask myself this question: which one I am interested more? I will say iOS and Japanese, during current life period. Now, I must add new element into my aesthetics. What is the new member? 

There are things in the world. Some you can have feelings easily. Some you can't. I must somehow see those I can't feel directly so I can measure how important they are to me and then personally lift their prominence to me so that I feel more natural to put time and efforts into it. Some are not interesting itself in Process but are extremely interesting in Result. So I have to somehow personally make the process interesting so that I fell more natural to put time and efforts into it.

See the good side, See the bad side. Not Covered by the good side, not Swept by the bad side.

When can't Perceive, I must Imagine.

Feeling is close to a Human. I am convinced Feeling is the right way. I give Feeling heavy weights. However and So, Feeling itself must be learnt more. The new knowledge about Feeling is that Horizon matters: Process, Result, Short-Term, Middle-Term, Long-Term.

I feel it's becoming a little boring and simple preparing interviewing questions, which confirms that I am such a person that seeks for Intelligence-Fun. I am glad that I am like that. So I am going to reward myself one round of Honor-of-King.

Honor-of-King makes minds not calming. I need to do one Japanese lesson for calming down.

I am really bored by the fake and ill-tasted UITableView performance problem. I need to tell myself to relax, get away from this trash, so my runloop will not be hurt.

A time has come when I need to decide what topic to dive more into. It's like when you have learn 2000 Japanese words, you should put more time on Grammar. Now, I should not only skip those ill-taste questions, but also be more selective to try to shape my Technique-Style. Thats what I said before that I want to be humble so I accept that I tap into the field and experience those interviewing questions. Now that I already experience, I can be more perspective and stylish. Is this again be self-centric and off track with reality? I don't think so since now I know more about what an interviewer wants.

My own goal this year is Code Quality, Practical Knowledge, Algorithms. I need to combine what ByteDance wants, what MS and Paypay wants, and what I myself want. This line of thoughts have some taste of Cooperating, which is getting to know what needs are there and see if I can fulfill some. This may be an easier motivation for a Human to drive himself.
