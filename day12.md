# Day12

I feel disturbed and a bit anxious. ZoZo-HR-Question and watching-wwdc-unsafe-swift together cause this emotion disturbance. The disturbance is actually just emotion-disturbance that can be calmed down physically. There is space for optimization. I should keep external connections only after dawn so that I can fully focus in daytime. Besides this optimization, the anxious emotion actually hint to me something.

What is the thing that anxious wants me to know? Facing knowledge and market, a human may be anxious. Knowledge and Market are both such a thing that a human is not familiar by himself. Facing something unfamiliar, it is valid for a human to be anxious. This anxious reminds me that I should be humble and drown myself into the field without thinking from my own bias. Listen, without myself, fully into the situation.
