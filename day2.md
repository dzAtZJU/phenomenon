# Day2

I sit down and want to play one round of game to start the day. I shall question this important status of the game. Why do I want to put it as the first thing to do, especially compared to Duolingo? They are both fun for me. Am I just accustomed to pick the game as first? Then this might be a bad habit, at least, it is short-sighted. May I be more long-sighted? Will this be acceptable by my feelings? Long-sighted means considering extra criteria.

Ask myself this question: Do my feelings like sighted or random? At the first look of this question, I choose sighted. Lets give it a try.

Turning up the sound actually make Duolingo more fun. I think thats because I feel Japanese sounds touching.

After playing games for one hour, I find it hard to switch to iOS. According to yesterday's experience, I should do Japanese for warming-up. Let's see if it will work. It do work. But is it natural enough now to switch to iOS? Facing time, how should I confront it?Do I just jump into iOS without knowing whether there is still any gap?Smooth is among my aesthetics so I want make sure there is no gap left. One thing that flashes into my mind is that I must somehow know the object I am going to deal with so that I have some feelings for it. The next object at this moment is notification posting. So what feelings do I have for it? What do I mean by smooth? Does it mean smooth from Japanese to iOS? That's a bold guess and I like it. I remember a professor will review what we have learned in previous class to begin this class. Also, If I am able to link Japanese and iOS, my life will be more consistent and as a whole, which is among my aesthetics.

scheduling at runloop idle \| 暇　.But it seems I am always busy that I always has my own things to do that I have no 暇 to handle this type of task. Since I find daily Japanese plain, what if I look up those more foundational concepts from iOS in Japanese? No, that is too big a leap.

I get hungry. Shall I go to PingChengWu to eat? That equals to leave and discard iOS after only meeting it for a while. Why do I prefer nice eating than iOS? If I like iOS, I should be staying with it as long as possible. Especially when I realize human relationships are not eternal and will hurt when break but relationship with iOS can be eternal. So is eternal also among my aesthetics? The benefits along with overhead and problems of Thread reminds me that eternal may also be a double-edged-sword. If I like it, I need to accept its dark side. The natural question comes that is there a perfect thing that has no dark side? Event if there is, I am not deserved for it since myself is not perfect. Thus, Tragedy joins my aesthetics. Maybe thats why I love music from Nils Frahm.

I have no idea that whether iOS itself is happy or not. All it has done is to make people happy. If I am going to be like iOS, then who can back me up? Is there an Apple backing me up? That's why a human need to be in a company since a company will backs him up. I keep thinking of too lazy to cute, maybe I want her backing me up. But again, human relationship can hurt. iOS is actually taken well since avoiding overhead is always in designer's mind. Who then cares about my overhead? The designer of iOS is actually really self-centered. The reason is that there is just too many tasks that iOS have to be considered first in case of harming. The designer try to keep iOS busy using pipeline technique.

At this point, an idea flashes into my mind that when I am reading I am actually putting myself under the Timing-FM of Writing. The writer, the topic, the links, my background all contribute to how fun this reading period can be. I am a little tired now but there is 30 mins before 6:00pm. Why do I want to keep reading until 6:00pm? Why dose that moment so prominent? Does this moment pushes me to hold on? Maybe it's because people can get together to play at this specific moment.

Delegate out and Cooperate should join my aesthetics. What important is achieving goal rather than proving yourself. Again, this is because Human is weak essentially.

I don't want to do reading anymore. I am tired. I think this is intrinsic to Reading-Based-Timing-FM.
