Reflection on Field.

What does it mean if I say I am good at OBJC? OBJC it self has heterogeneous aspects, for instances, memory-management, storage-qualifier, property-attribute, life-cycle, initialization. It's easy to get lost and schizophrenia. I do believe the writer tried best to do his work. So the language and text itself is the limit and constraint and the blame. The responsibility fall off on each reader. It's my responsibility to make it coherent and thus fun. Those concepts are actually on different levels of PL. From the perspective of application and programming guide, how do these concepts sit? I have to figure it out. Now a new member should join my Aesthetics, that is Coherent.

What about Time? I wanted to reflect on it last night. I get tired and bored in reading so I gave up and went to a walk, hang out in micro-light. Does this bad experience justify negating the activity Preparing-Interview? The fact is after I slept a night, coming into today, I have less feelings that I should negate that and feel that I just need to try new approach. I didn't doubt that as before because it is a must I need to face I have no other choice and I have to face that. Now the conclusion is that Reality is what you have to face no matter how it hurts my feelings. Yes, there is possibility that I can escape the Reality or change the Reality. However, currently I have no such way out.

Reality can hurt Feeling. When Escape or Reform is not yet mature, Facing becomes the only choice. Facing, is, to get a healing sleep, to face it in a different way than yesterday, to make daily routine fun somehow.
